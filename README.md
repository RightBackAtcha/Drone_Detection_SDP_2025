**California Polytechnic State University, Pomona**  
**Senior Design Project 2024-2025**

This repository contains the full implementation of a drone detection, classification, and mitigation system leveraging **Software-Defined Radios (SDRs)** and **Machine Learning**. The project explores the use of RF signal analysis to identify drone activity, classify commands, and perform replay attacks for mitigation testing.

## Overview

The proliferation of drones presents new security challenges. This project provides a proof-of-concept for:

- **Detecting** the presence of drones using RF spectrum monitoring.
- **Classifying** drone commands and behaviors (e.g., idle, move, accelerate).
- **Mitigating** drone threats using replay attacks that exploit communication vulnerabilities.

## Features

- üì∂ **Signal Acquisition**: Captured drone RF signals using SDRs (e.g., HackRF One).
- üéµ **Feature Extraction**: Used Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) to extract features from raw IQ samples.
- ü§ñ **Machine Learning**: Trained Support Vector Machines (SVMs) for drone command classification.
- üîÅ **Replay Attacks**: Implemented RF replay to disrupt or control drone behavior.

## Methodology

1. **Data Collection**  
   Recorded RF signal samples from drones performing various commands using SDR hardware.

2. **Preprocessing**  
   Extracted MFCC features from sampled signals for machine learning classification.

3. **Model Training**  
   Used an SVM classifier to distinguish between drone models based on their MFCC features.

4. **Replay Attack**  
   Replayes drone-landing RF signals from dataset to force classified drone to land.
